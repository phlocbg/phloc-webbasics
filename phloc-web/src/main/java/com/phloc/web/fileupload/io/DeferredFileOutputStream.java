/**
 * An output stream which will retain data in memory until a specified threshold
 * is reached, and only then commit it to disk. If the stream is closed before
 * the threshold is reached, the data will not be written to disk at all.
 * <p>
 * This class originated in FileUpload processing. In this use case, you do not
 * know in advance the size of the file being uploaded. If the file is small you
 * want to store it in memory (for speed), but if the file is large you want to
 * store it to file (to avoid memory issues).
